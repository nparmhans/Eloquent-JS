##Summary
JavaScript programs may inspect and interfere with the current document that a browser is displaying through a data structure called the DOM. This data structure represents the browser’s model of the document, and a JavaScript program can modify it to change the visible document.

The DOM is organized like a tree, in which elements are arranged hierarchically according to the structure of the document. The objects representing elements have properties like parentNode and childNodes, which can be used to navigate through this tree.

The way a document is displayed can be influenced by styling, both by attaching styles to nodes directly, and by defining rules that match certain nodes. There are many different style properties, such as color or display. JavaScript can manipulate an element’s style directly through its style property.

##Challenges

##Challange 1: Build A Table
We built plain-text tables in Chapter 6. HTML makes laying out tables quite a bit easier. An HTML table is built with the following tag structure:

```
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>name</th>
    <th>height</th>
    <th>country</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Kilimanjaro</td>
    <td>5895</td>
    <td>Tanzania</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

For each *row* , the *<table>* tag contains a *<tr>* tag. Inside of these, we can put cell elements: either heading cells ( *<th>* ) or regular cells ( *<td>* ).

The same source data that was used in <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/06_object.html#mountains">Chapter 6</a> is again available in the *MOUNTAINS* variable in the sandbox, and also <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/code/mountains.js">downloadable</a> from the list of data sets on the website.

Write a function *buildTable* that, given an array of objects that all have the same set of properties, builds up a DOM structure representing a table. The table should have a header row with the property names wrapped in *<th>* elements, and one subsequent row per object in the array, with its property values in *<td>* elements.

The Object.keys function, which returns an array containing the property names that an object has, will probably be helpful here.

Once you have the basics working, right-align cells containing numbers by setting their style.textAlign property to *"right"* :

```
<style>
  /* Defines a cleaner look for tables */
  table  { border-collapse: collapse; }
  td, th { border: 1px solid black; padding: 3px 8px; }
  th     { text-align: left; }
</style>

<script>
  function buildTable(data) {
    // Your code here.
  }

  document.body.appendChild(buildTable(MOUNTAINS));
</script>
```

##Challange 2: Elements By Tag Name
The getElementsByTagName method returns all child elements with a given tag name. Implement your own version of it, as a regular non-method function, which takes a node and a string (the tag name) as arguments, and returns an array containing all descendant element nodes with the given tag name.

To find the tag name of an element, use its tagName property. But note that this will return the tag name in all upper case. Use the toLowerCase or toUpperCase string method to compensate for this.

```
<h1>Heading with a <span>span</span> element.</h1>
<p>A paragraph with <span>one</span>, <span>two</span>
  spans.</p>

<script>
  function byTagName(node, tagName) {
    // Your code here.
  }

  console.log(byTagName(document.body, "h1").length);
  // → 1
  console.log(byTagName(document.body, "span").length);
  // → 3
  var para = document.querySelector("p");
  console.log(byTagName(para, "span").length);
  // → 2
</script>
```
